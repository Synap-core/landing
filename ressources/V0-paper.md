**SYNAPSE: The Single Source of Truth**

A unified data foundation for the AI era

**🎯 Vision**

**A world where your data works for you, not against you.**

Where applications compete to add value to YOUR ecosystem instead of trapping you in their silos. Where artificial intelligence enhances your information instead of fragmenting it across dozens of platforms. Where switching tools is effortless because your data is yours, portable, and structured.

The future isn't more apps—it's smarter infrastructure.

**🚀 Mission**

**We're building Synapse: a personal data core that unifies everything you create, think, and manage—with AI-powered applications that sit on top.**

Instead of your data living in isolated SaaS silos, it lives in YOUR infrastructure—structured, queryable, and extensible. Applications become intelligent layers that use your data with your permission, not gatekeepers that lock it away.

**💡 The Philosophy: What Blockchain Promised, Done Right**

**Every major innovation makes the previous scarce resource abundant.**

When agriculture advanced, food became cheaper. When manufacturing scaled, goods became accessible. When the internet emerged, information became free.

**Now, with AI, data should become free—not in price, but in ownership.**

Blockchain tried to solve this through decentralization. It failed because it led with ideology instead of experience. Users don't want decentralization—they want **interoperability, ownership, and control.**

**We deliver the blockchain vision without the blockchain baggage:**

•	✅ True data ownership (you host it or we do—your choice)

•	✅ Interoperability (apps plug into YOUR data, not their servers)

•	✅ Intelligence-as-a-service (AI works ON your data, doesn't own it)

•	❌ No cryptocurrency

•	❌ No gas fees

•	❌ No technical complexity

**🔥 The Problem We're Solving**

**The Current Reality:**

Your digital life is shattered across dozens of platforms:

•	Tasks in Todoist, Asana, or Linear

•	Notes in Notion, Obsidian, or Evernote

•	Calendar in Google, Outlook, or Apple

•	Projects in Jira, Monday, or ClickUp

•	Files in Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive

•	Communication in Slack, Discord, or Teams

**Each platform:**

•	Owns your data

•	Forces you into their workflows

•	Makes switching painful (vendor lock-in)

•	Doesn't integrate well with others

•	Builds features based on their business model, not your needs

**The result:**

•	You waste hours copying information between tools

•	Your data is incomplete and fragmented

•	AI assistants can't help you because they can't see your full context

•	You're afraid to switch tools because migration is hell

•	You pay multiple subscriptions for overlapping features

**This isn't just inefficient—it's a tax on human productivity.**

**✨ Our Solution: The Three-Layer Architecture**

**Layer 1: Synapse Core (Your Data Foundation)**

**An event-driven personal database that stores everything:**

•	Tasks, events, notes, projects, files, contacts—all in one unified system

•	Fully typed and structured (not just files and folders)

•	Event-sourced (complete history of every change)

•	Extensible (new capabilities can be added dynamically)

•	Yours (self-host or we host—your data, your choice)

**Think of it as:**

•	A personal database that's as easy to use as Notion

•	An operating system for your digital life

•	Infrastructure that outlasts any single application

**Layer 2: Intelligence Layers (AI That Understands YOU)**

**Applications don't own your data—they provide intelligence ON your data:**

**Example: Our First App - Universal Input**

•	One text box for everything

•	AI interprets what you mean

•	Automatically creates tasks, events, notes, projects

•	Learns your patterns over time

**Example: Future Apps**

•	CRMs that share the same contact database

•	Project management tools that sync with your tasks automatically

•	Analytics that understand your complete work patterns

•	Calendars that know about your projects, not just events

**The magic:** All apps see the same unified data. No imports, exports, or syncing. Just different lenses on YOUR information.

**Layer 3: The Marketplace (Ecosystem of Innovation)**

**Developers build apps that plug into Synapse:**

•	Time trackers

•	Invoice generators

•	Goal trackers

•	Habit trackers

•	Mind mapping tools

•	Custom analytics dashboards

•	AI agents and automation workflows

**Users choose the best interfaces and intelligence layers for their needs.**

**Developers focus on creating great experiences, not managing infrastructure.**

**We take a small percentage—platform economics that reward innovation.**

**🏆 Market Position: How We Compare**

**We're Not The First to Try—We're The First With The Right Model**

Product

What They Got Right

Where They Failed

What We Do Differently

**Notion**

Unified workspace, flexible data

Data siloed in their platform, no true extensibility

Your data is portable; apps are modular

**Airtable**

Structured data, good API

Still a silo; limited AI; complex for basic use

AI-native UX; simpler mental model

**Solid Project / Urbit**

Data ownership philosophy

Too technical; no killer apps; ideological

Practical UX; immediate value; developer-friendly

**Zapier / Make**

Connects apps together

Just moves data between silos; doesn't unify it

Native unified data layer; no "glue" needed

**Obsidian**

Local-first, extensible

File-based (not structured); no AI-native integration

Structured database; AI-first architecture

**Salesforce / Odoo**

Extensible platform model

Enterprise-focused; terrible UX; expensive

Consumer-grade UX; affordable; modern stack

**Our Unique Position:**

**We're the intersection of:**

1.	**Data ownership** (like Solid/Urbit)

2.	**Extensibility** (like Salesforce/Odoo)

3.	**AI-native UX** (like modern chat interfaces)

4.	**Developer-friendly** (like Vercel/Supabase)

5.	**Pragmatic onboarding** (freemium SaaS → owned infrastructure)

**No one else occupies this space.**

**💫 User Experience: What It Feels Like**

**The Daily Flow:**

**Morning:**

•	Open Synapse

•	See your day: tasks, events, notes—all in one view

•	Type: "Call with Maria at 2pm about Q4 budget review, need to prepare slides"

•	AI instantly creates the event, links to the Q4 project, creates a task

**Afternoon:**

•	Working on a design project

•	Switch to the project view (same data, different lens)

•	AI suggests relevant notes from 2 months ago you'd forgotten

•	One of your teammates adds a comment—it appears in real-time

**Evening:**

•	Review what you accomplished

•	AI generates a summary and suggests what to prioritize tomorrow

•	Your time-tracking app (third-party) shows exactly where your hours went—no manual entry

**Switching Tools:**

•	Try a new task manager from the marketplace

•	It instantly shows all your existing tasks—no import needed

•	Don't like it? Switch back in one click

•	Your data never moved

**Self-Hosting:**

•	🔄 **From vendor lock-in to true interoperability**

•	🔄 **From dumb storage to intelligent infrastructure**

•	🔄 **From "users serve platforms" to "platforms serve users"**

**📐 Our Design Principles**

These principles guide every decision we make:

**1. Data Ownership is Non-Negotiable**

Your data is yours. We make money by being excellent hosts and creating great intelligence layers—never by trapping your information.

**2. Intelligence, Not Storage, is the Value**

The commodity is data storage. The value is in AI, insights, and experiences built on top.

**3. Interoperability Over Integration**

Don't connect silos—eliminate them. All apps work with the same unified data.

**4. Pragmatism Over Ideology**

We don't force users to self-host on day one. We make it easy to start (hosted) and easy to own (self-hosted) when ready.

**5. Extensibility is Core, Not an Afterthought**

The platform grows through capabilities added by us AND the community. No feature should require our permission.

**6. AI-Native from Day One**

This isn't a database with AI bolted on. Intelligence is woven into every interaction.

**7. Developer Experience Determines Ecosystem Health**

If developers love building on Synapse, the ecosystem thrives. If not, it dies. We optimize for builder joy.

**8. User Experience Can't Be Compromised**

Data ownership is worthless if the UX is bad. We refuse to sacrifice delight for technical purity.
